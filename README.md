# Personal Financial Manager

## Overview
The **Personal Financial Manager** is a web application designed to help users track their expenses and manage their finances. The backend is built with Django, while the frontend uses HTML and CSS with Bootstrap for a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## System Architecture
The architecture is composed of:
1. **Backend (Django)** - Manages data processing, user authentication, and business logic.
2. **Frontend (HTML, CSS with Bootstrap)** - Provides a responsive user interface for interacting with the application.
3. **Database** - Stores user-specific financial data, including expenses and income.

This architecture ensures a clear separation between the backend logic and frontend display, making the application more maintainable and scalable.

## Django Architecture Pattern: Model-View-Template (MVT)
Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, which is similar to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern but adapted for web development. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the components in Django's MVT architecture:

1. **Model**  
   The Model is responsible for the data layer of the application. It defines the structure of the data, including the fields and behaviors of the data stored in the database. Each model class typically represents a database table. Django provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that enables easy interaction with the database.  
   Example: `models.py` file contains model classes (e.g., User, Product) defining the attributes and relationships between them.

2. **View**  
   The View handles the application logic and processes user requests. It fetches data from the Model and sends it to the Template for rendering. In Django, views can be either function-based or class-based, offering flexibility in handling HTTP requests and responses.  
   Example: `views.py` file defines functions or classes (e.g., ProductListView, UserDetailView) that retrieve data and determine how it should be displayed.

3. **Template**  
   The Template layer is responsible for presenting the data to the user. It contains HTML files that define the structure and layout of the web pages. Django templates use Django Template Language (DTL) to dynamically insert data passed from views into the HTML content.  
   Example: `templates` folder contains HTML files (e.g., product_list.html, user_detail.html) that render the output.

## Design Patterns
This project incorporates several design patterns to address specific design needs:

1. **Singleton** (Creational)  
   - Ensures only one instance of essential services exists across the application, reducing redundant instantiation and maintaining a single source of truth.
   - **Example**: The Singleton pattern is applied to manage key services, ensuring that only one instance of each service is created throughout the application.

2. **Factory Method** (Creational)  
   - Facilitates the creation of specific types of objects, enabling flexible and decoupled code.
   - **Example**: Used to generate different types of users, allowing for scalable and manageable user creation processes.

3. **Observer** (Behavioral)  
   - Provides a subscription mechanism to notify different parts of the system when changes occur.
   - **Example**: The Observer pattern monitors changes in data (such as expenses) and sends notifications, ensuring that users are updated in real time when relevant data is modified.

4. **Facade** (Structural)  
   - **Purpose**: The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier for clients to interact with it without needing to understand the details. It groups and manages several classes and services, allowing other parts of the application to access them through a single, unified interface.
   - **Example in Project**: The **FinanceFacade** class in this project centralizes financial operations by encapsulating the balance calculations and notification system, making it easier to manage and interact with these features. By using the Facade pattern, the project can access methods related to financial summaries, transactions, and notifications through a single access point, reducing code complexity and improving maintainability.

## UML Diagrams
Currently, UML diagrams are not available for this project. Future updates may include:
- **Class Diagram** - To illustrate the relationships and patterns applied within the system.
- **Sequence Diagram** - To show the flow of interactions, such as expense management and balance updates.

These diagrams will provide a clearer view of the project structure and design patterns.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Installation**
   - Clone the repository: `https://github.com/alisherseitkadyr/Personal-Financial-Manager.git`
   - Install dependencies for the backend:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

2. **Running the Application**
   - Start the Django server:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```
   - Open a browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to use the application.

3. **Register and Login**
   - Register a new user account or log in to access the application's financial management features.

4. **Tracking Finances**
   - Use the web interface to add, view, and manage expenses and monitor balance updates.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- **User-specific data** - Each user has a separate balance and financial records.
- **No Internet Connection Dependency** - The application operates fully offline, without requiring an internet connection.

**Limitations**:
- **No Multi-device Synchronization** - The current version does not support data synchronization across multiple devices or sharing a common database across users.
- **Limited Analytics** - The application offers only basic expense and income tracking without advanced financial analysis or forecasting features.
- **Single Currency Support** - The application currently supports only one currency, with no option for currency conversion.
- **No Automatic Data Backup** - Users do not have built-in options for cloud or local backup of their financial data.
